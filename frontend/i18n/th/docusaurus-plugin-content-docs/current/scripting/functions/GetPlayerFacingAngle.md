## บันทึก

:::tip

Angles returned when inside a vehicle is rarely correct. To get the correct facing angle while inside a vehicle, use GetVehicleZAngle.

:::

:::warning

Angles are reversed in GTA:SA; 90 degrees would be East in the real world, but in GTA:SA 90 degrees is in fact West. North and South are still 0/360 and 180. To convert this, simply do 360 - angle.
