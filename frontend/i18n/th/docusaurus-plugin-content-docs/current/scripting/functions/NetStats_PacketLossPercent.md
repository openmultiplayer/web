## คำอธิบาย

Gets the packet loss percentage of a player. Packet loss means data the player is sending to the server is being lost (or vice-versa).

| Name     | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| playerid | The ID of the player to get the data from. |

## ส่งคืน

The percentage packet loss as a float. 0 if player not connected.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid,cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp(cmdtext, "/packetloss"))
    {
        new szString[144];
        format(szString, sizeof(szString), "Packets lost: %.2f percent.", NetStats_PacketLossPercent(playerid));
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, szString);
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## บันทึก

:::tip

Be advised that this function will report the packets lost by the server. The packet loss number reported by the client **will** be different, not because either is incorrect, but because both the server and the client are only aware of the loss packages sent by them.

:::tip

Anything greater than 0.0% should already be a cause of concern. Anything greater than 1.0% is outright bad.
