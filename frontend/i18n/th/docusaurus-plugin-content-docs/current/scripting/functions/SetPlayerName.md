## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Command simply sets the player's name to to "Superman" if possible, with no error checking or messages.
if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/superman", true) == 0)
{
    SetPlayerName(playerid, "Superman");
    return 1;
}

// Command sets the players name to "Superman" if possible, informs the player of
// any errors using a "switch" statement.
if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/superman", true) == 0)
{
    switch (SetPlayerName(playerid, "Superman"))
    {
        case -1:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFF0000FF, "Unable to change your name, someone else is known as 'Superman' already.");
        }
        case 0:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFF0000FF, "You are already known as 'Superman'");
        }
        case 1:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0x00FF00FF, "You are now known as 'Superman'");
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## บันทึก

:::warning

Changing the players' name to the same name but with different character cases (e.g. "John" to "JOHN") will not work. If used in OnPlayerConnect, the new name will not be shown for the connecting player. Passing a null string as the new name will crash the server. Player names can be up to 24 characters when using this function, but when joining the server from the SA-MP server browser, players' names must be no more than 20 and less than 3 characters (the server will deny entry). This allows for 4 characters extra when using SetPlayerName.
