## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Make player 42 see player 1 as a red marker
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer( 42, 1, 0xFF0000FF );

// Make the players marker an invisible white (chat will be white but marker will be gone).
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer( 42, 1, 0xFFFFFF00 );

// Make the players marker invisible to the player while keeping chat colour the same. Will only work correctly if SetPlayerColor has been used:
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer( 42, 1, ( GetPlayerColor( 1 ) & 0xFFFFFF00 ) );

// Make the players marker fully opaque (solid) to the player while keeping chat colour the same. Will only work correctly if SetPlayerColor has been used:
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer( 42, 1, ( GetPlayerColor( 1 ) | 0x000000FF ) );
```
