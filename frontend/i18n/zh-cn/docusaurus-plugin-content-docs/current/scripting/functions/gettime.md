| &second=0 | The variable to store the seconds in, passed by reference. |

## Returns

The function itself returns a Unix Timestamp.

## Examples

```c
new
	hours,
	minutes,
	seconds,
	timestamp;

timestamp = gettime(hours, minutes, seconds);
printf("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds);
printf("Seconds since midnight 1st January 1970: %d", timestamp);
```

## Notes

:::tip

This function is useful for measuring time intervals by using its timestamp characteristics. This can be particularly useful if you want to restrict some functionality based on a time (e.g. a command that can only be executed every 30 seconds). Using this method you don't have to rely on timers.
