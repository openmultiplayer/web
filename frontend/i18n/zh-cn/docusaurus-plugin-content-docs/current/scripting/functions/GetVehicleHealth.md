## Notes

:::tip

Full vehicle health is 1000, however higher values are possible and increase the health of the vehicle. For more information on health values, see [here](../resources/vehiclehealth).

:::tip

A vehicle catches on fire when its health is below 250. It will explode a few seconds later.
