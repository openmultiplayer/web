:::tip

The param 'weaponslot' is a typo in the sa-mp include. You must use the weapon ID and not the weapon slot of the weapon you would like to set the ammo of.

Set the ammo to 0 to remove a weapon from a player's inventory. Note that the weapon will still show up in [GetPlayerWeaponData](GetPlayerWeaponData), albeit with 0 ammo.
