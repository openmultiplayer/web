This is a sneak-peek at one of the improved modules we've done, for timers in open.mp:

```c
native SetTimer(const func[], msInterval, bool:repeat) = SetTimerEx;
native SetTimerEx(const func[], msInterval, bool:repeat, const params[], GLOBAL_TAG_TYPES:...);
native KillTimer(timer) = Timer_Kill;

// CreateTimer
native Timer:Timer_Create(const func[], usDelay, usInterval, repeatCount, const params[] = "", GLOBAL_TAG_TYPES:...);

// KillTimer
native bool:Timer_Kill(Timer:timer);

// Return time till next call.
native Timer_GetTimeRemaining(Timer:timer);

// Get number of calls left to make (0 for unlimited).
native Timer_GetCallsRemaining(Timer:timer);

// Get `repeatCount` parameter.
native Timer_GetTotalCalls(Timer:timer);

//  Get `usInterval` parameter.
native Timer_GetInterval(Timer:timer);

// Reset time remaining till next call to `usInterval`.
native bool:Timer_Restart(Timer:timer);
```

The first two are just for backwards-compatibility, the rest are the improved API:

```c
native Timer:Timer_Create(const func[], usDelay, usInterval, repeatCount, const params[] = "", GLOBAL_TAG_TYPES:...);
```

- `func` - Fairly obvious; what to call.
- `usDelay` - Again obvious, the delay before the call (in microseconds).
- `usInterval` - What to reset usDelay to after the first call. So if you wanted a timer on the hour every hour, but it was 8:47am right now, the call would be `Timer_Create("OnTheHour", 780 SECONDS, 3600 SECONDS, 0);`
- `repeatCount` - Unlike the old functions, which are just "once" or "forever", this instead takes the number of times to call the function. "once" would be `1`, `500` would stop after 500 calls, and (backwards from the old API) `0` means "forever".
- `GLOBAL_TAG_TYPES` - Like `{Float, ...}`, but with more tags.
