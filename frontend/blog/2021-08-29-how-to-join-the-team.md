## How can I join the team?

We get asked this question a LOT, so we thought we should make a post about it!

Firstly, thanks so much for being interested in contributing!

As you know, we are all veteran SA-MP players who came together to keep the world of SA multiplayer alive. We are passionate about the project being FOR the players and BY the players, and this is why it will eventually be open-source.

## Development

We are currently working on the finishing touches for the beta release, and once that is live we would greatly appreciate and welcome contributions from the community! We will need help testing functionalities and edge cases, and of course looking for bugs and other issues that need work.

The beta test will be an extremely important part of the development journey, and we would love for everyone to be involved, so please stay tuned for the announcement of the beta test, which we promise is going to be really, really soon!

## Regional Co-ordinators

Do you speak English AND another language, both fluently? We would love your help to translate our Wiki pages, our blog posts, and our social media posts, and to help moderate the language sections of our Discord and our forum.

Applications for these positions are currently closed while we make some changes, but they will be open again soon!

## Other ways to help

- SHARE our social media posts
- INVITE other SA players to our Discord (discord.gg/samp)
- ENGAGE in our community on Discord
- HELP other players on Discord (scripting, tech, whatever!)
