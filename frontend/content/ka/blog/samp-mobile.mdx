The open.mp team's views on SA-MP for Android

Hi everyone,

We just wanted to write a quick blog post about our views on SA-MP for Android, because we have been getting a lot of comments about it on our YouTube videos and on Discord.

As we stated in our YouTube video, we do not support the current version of SA-MP for Android. This app was created using source code which was stolen from the SA-MP team, which makes the app illegal.

We do not condone the theft of other people's code, and we do not condone the use of stolen code. We also do not associate with illegal activities.

We see that GTA SA multiplayer for mobile has a large community, and we would like to welcome this community into open.mp.

We are currently discussing how we can create our own multiplayer mod for SA mobile, so that it will be done legally and fairly! :)

This means that it is very possible that there will be open.mp for mobile in the future, so please keep supporting us while we figure it out!

We invite the mobile community to join our official Discord with over 7000 members, we have created a channel for you at #samp-android and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and opinions!

See you there!
