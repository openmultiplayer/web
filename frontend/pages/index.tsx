    <p>
      An upcoming multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that will be
      fully backwards compatible with the existing multiplayer mod San Andreas
      Multiplayer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means the existing SA:MP client and all existing SA:MP scripts will
      work with open.mp and, in addition to this, many bugs will also be fixed
      within the server software without the need for hacks and workarounds.
