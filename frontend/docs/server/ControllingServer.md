## Changing Gamemode

### Running a custom/downloaded gamemode

- Open the directory you installed the server to (eg: /Rockstar Games/GTA San Andreas/server)
- Take the downloaded/compiled .amx file and place it in the gamemodes folder where you installed the server
- Use RCON to change the mode.
- Alternatively you can add the new mode to a rotation.

### Using Filterscripts

The same as running a custom gamemode, except:

- Place the .amx in a folder called `filterscripts`
- Add the following to server.cfg: `filterscripts <scriptname>`

## Passwording your server

- If you want to add a password so only your friends can join, add this to [server.cfg](server.cfg):

```
password whatever
```

- This will make your server password-protected with the password set as 'whatever' - change it to whatever you want.
- You can also change the password while ingame by using `/rcon password newpasswordhere`
- You can remove the password by using `/rcon password 0`, or by restarting the server.

## Using RCON

### Logging In

You can log in either while ingame by typing `/rcon login password` or out of game by using the RCON mode in the [Remote Console](RemoteConsole).

The password is the same as what you set it as in [server.cfg](server.cfg)

### Adding Bans

##### samp.ban

samp.ban is the file used for storing bans, including the following information about the ban:

- IP
- Date
- Time
- Name (Name of person or a reason, see [BanEx](../../functions/BanEx))
- Type of ban

To add a ban, simply add a line like so:

```
IP_HERE [28/05/09 | 13:37:00] PLAYER - BAN REASON
```

Where `IP_HERE` is, is where you put the IP you would like to ban.

##### Ban() function

The [Ban](../scripting/functions/Ban) function can be used to ban a player from a script. The [BanEx](../scripting/functions/BanEx) function will add an optional reason like so:

```
13.37.13.37 [28/05/09 | 13:37:00] Cheater - INGAME BAN
```

##### RCON ban command

The RCON ban command, executed by typing /rcon ban in-game or typing "ban" in the console, is used to ban a specific player that is on your server, to ban an IP see the next section.

Simply type:

```
# Ingame:
/rcon ban PLAYERID

# Console:
ban PLAYERID
```

##### banip

The RCON banip command, executed by typing /rcon banip in-game or typing "banip" in the console, is used to ban a specific IP address, to ban a player on your server by ID, see the previous section. Will accept wildcards for rangebans.

Simply type:

```
# Ingame:
/rcon banip IP

# Console:
banip IP
```

### Removing Bans

Once somebody is banned, there are two ways to unban them.

- Remove from samp.ban
- The RCON `unbanip` command

#### samp.ban

samp.ban can be found in your sa-mp server directory, it contains lines with the following information about each ban:

- IP
- Date
- Time
- Name (Name of person or a reason (see [BanEx](../scripting/functions/BanEx)))
- Type of ban (INGAME, IP BAN etc,)

Examples:

```
127.8.57.32 [13/06/09 | 69:69:69] NONE - IP BAN
13.37.13.37 [28/05/09 | 13:37:00] Kyeman - INGAME BAN
```

To unban them, simply remove the line, then execute the RCON reloadbans command to make the server re-read samp.ban.

#### unbanip

The RCON unbanip command can be used in-game or from the server console (black box). To unban an ip, simply type `/rcon unbanip IP_HERE` in-game or `unbanip IP_HERE` in the console.

Example:

```
13.37.13.37 [28/05/09 | 13:37:00] Kyeman - INGAME BAN
```

```
# Ingame:
/rcon unbanip 13.37.13.37

# Console
unbanip 13.37.13.37
```

To unban them, simply use the `unbanip` command, then execute the RCON `reloadbans` command to make the server re-read samp.ban.

#### reloadbans

`samp.ban` is a file that holds the information for the IP's that are currently banned from the server. This file is read when the server is started, so if you unban an IP/person you MUST type the RCON `reloadbans` command to make the server read `samp.ban` again and allow them to join the server.

### RCON Commands

Type cmdlist for commands (or, varlist for variables) making use of the RCON in-game (`/rcon cmdlist`).

These are the functions that you as admin can use:

| Command                           | Description                                                                                                                                          |

The above four limits/counts are just made to avoid several tools which can attack any SA-MP server by freezing it or crashing. So, simply, just set them according to your server. The default values are default, if you see any wrong kicks, just increase the values as soon as possible so that the innocent players won't get kicked by it.
