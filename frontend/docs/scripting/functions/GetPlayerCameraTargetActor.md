    // Find out what actor (if any) the player is LOOKING at
    new playerTargetActor = GetPlayerCameraTargetActor(playerid);

    // If they ARE looking at ANY actor
    if (playerTargetActor != INVALID_ACTOR_ID)
    {
        // Store the player's weapon so we can check if they are armed
        new playerWeapon = GetPlayerWeapon(playerid);

        new KEY:keys, updown, leftright;

        // If the actor hasn't put its hands up yet, AND the player is ARMED
        if (!ActorHandsup[playerTargetActor] && playerWeapon >= 22 && playerWeapon <= 42 && keys & KEY_AIM)
        {

            ApplyActorAnimation(playerTargetActor, "SHOP", "SHP_HandsUp_Scr",4.1,0,0,0,1,0);

            // Set 'ActorHandsup' to true, so the animation won't keep being reapplied

        }
    }
    return 1;
}

## Notes

:::tip

This function only tells you which actor (if any) the player is looking at. To find out if they are aiming at them, you need to use GetPlayerTargetActor.

:::warning

This function is disabled by default to save bandwidth. Use [EnablePlayerCameraTarget](EnablePlayerCameraTarget) to enable it for each player.
