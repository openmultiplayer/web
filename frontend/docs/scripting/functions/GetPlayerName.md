{
    // Get the name of the player that connected and display a join message to other players

    new name[MAX_PLAYER_NAME + 1];
    GetPlayerName(playerid, name, sizeof(name));

    new string[128];
    format(string, sizeof(string), "%s has joined the server.", name);
    SendClientMessageToAll(0xC4C4C4FF, string);

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

A player's name can be up to 24 characters long by using [SetPlayerName](SetPlayerName).

This is defined as `MAX_PLAYER_NAME`.

However, the client can only join with a nickname between 3 and 20 characters, otherwise the connection will be rejected and the player has to quit to choose a valid name.
