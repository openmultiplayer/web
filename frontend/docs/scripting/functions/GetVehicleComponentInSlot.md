Known Bug(s):

- Doesn't work for CARMODTYPE_STEREO.

- Both rear bull bars and rear bumper components are saved in the CARMODTYPE_REAR_BUMPER slot. If a vehicle has both of them installed, this function will only return the one which was installed last.
- Both left side skirt and right side skirt are saved in the CARMODTYPE_SIDESKIRT slot. If a vehicle has both of them installed, this function will only return the one which was installed last.
