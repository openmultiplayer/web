| type         | The [type](../resources/explosionlist) of the explosion. |
| Float:radius | The radius of the explosion.                             |

## Returns

This function always returns 1, even when the explosion type and/or radius values are invalid.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerEnterCheckpoint(playerid)
{
    // Get the player's position
    new Float:x, Float:y, Float:z;
    GetPlayerPos(playerid, x, y, z);

    // Create an explosion at the player's position
    CreateExplosion(x, y, z, 12, 10.0);

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

There is a limit as to how many explosions can be seen at once by a player. This is roughly 10.
