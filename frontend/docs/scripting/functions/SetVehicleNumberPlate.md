## Notes

:::tip

- This function has no internal error checking.
- Do not assign custom number plates to vehicles without plates (boats, planes, etc) as this will result in some unneeded processing time on the client.
- The vehicle must be re-spawned or re-streamed for the changes to take effect.
- There's a limit of 32 characters on each number plate (including embedded colors).
- The text length that can be seen on the number plate is around 9 to 10 characters, more characters will cause the text to split.
- Some vehicle models has a backward number plate, e.g. Boxville (498) (as an alternative to this vehicle you can use vehicle model ID 609, which is a duplicated Boxville (aka Boxburg), but with a regular number plate).

:::

:::tip

You can use color embedding on the number plate text.
