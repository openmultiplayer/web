**0** - The function failed to execute. This means the player specified does not exist.

}

## Notes

:::tip

The function's name is armour, not armor (Americanized). This is inconsistent with the rest of SA-MP, so remember that.

:::

:::warning

Armour is obtained rounded to integers: set 50.15, but get 50.0
