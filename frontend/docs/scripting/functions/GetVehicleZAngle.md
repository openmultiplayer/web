## Description

Get the rotation of a vehicle on the Z axis (yaw).

| Name         | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| vehicleid    | The ID of the vehicle to get the Z angle of.                            |
| &Float:angle | A float variable in which to store the Z rotation, passed by reference. |

## Returns

**true** - The function was executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. This means the vehicle does not exist.

The vehicle's rotation is stored in the specified variable.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
     if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/vehrot", true) == 0)
     {
          new
               vehicleid,
               Float:rotZ,
               string[64];

          vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid);
          
          GetVehicleZAngle(vehicleid, rotZ);
          
          format(string, sizeof(string), "The current vehicle rotation is: %.0f", rotZ);
          SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, string);
          return 1;
     }
     return 0;
}
```
