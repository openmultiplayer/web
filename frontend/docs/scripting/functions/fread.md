## Description

Read a single line from a file.

| Name                   | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File:handle            | The handle of the file to read from (returned by fopen).       |
| string[]               | A string array to store the read text in, passed by reference. |
| size = sizeof (string) | The number of bytes to read.                                   |
| bool:pack              | Should the string be packed? (default: false).                 |

## Returns

The length of string (the read text) as an integer.

## Examples

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read);

// Initialize "buf"
new buf[128];

// Check, if the file is opened
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf))
    {
        print(buf);
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```

<br />

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read and write" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt");

// Initialize "buf"
new buf[128];

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf))
    {
        print(buf);
    }

    // Set the file pointer to the first byte
    fseek(handle, _, seek_begin);

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```
