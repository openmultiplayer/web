# Operators and expressions

---

### • Notational conventions

The operation of some operators depends on the specific kinds of operands.
Therefore, operands are notated thus:

| Operators | Usage                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| e         | any expression;                                                         |
| v         | any expression to which a value can be assigned (“lvalue” expressions); |
| a         | an array;                                                               |
| f         | a function;                                                             |
| s         | a symbol —which is a variable, a constant or a function.                |

### • Expressions

An expression consists of one or more operands with an operator. The operand
can be a variable, a constant or another expression. An expression followed by
a semicolon is a statement.

Listing: examples of expressions

```c

v++
f(a1, a2)
v = (ia1 * ia2) / ia3

```

### • Assignment

The result of an assignment expression is the value of the left operand after the assignment. The left operand may not be tagged.

|       | If “v” is an array, it must have an explicit size and “e” must be an array of the same size; “e” may be a string or a literal array.                                                              |
| Note  | the following operators combine an assignment with an arithmetic or a bitwise operation; the result of the expression is the value of the left operand after the arithmetic or bitwise operation. |

### • Operator precedence

The table beneath groups operators with equal precedence, starting with the
operator group with the highest precedence at the top of the table.

If the expression evaluation order is not explicitly established by parentheses,
it is determined by the association rules. For example: a*b/c is
equivalent with (a*b)/c because of the left-to-right association, and a=b=c is equivalent with a=(b=c).
