## Tools

* ***[Community Compiler](https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler/)*** - A vastly updated version of the compiler, with many fixes and enhancements.
* ***[sampctl](http://sampctl.com/)*** - Package manager for installing libraries and running your server.
* ***[Plugin Runner](https://github.com/Zeex/samp-plugin-runner/)*** - Tool to run a lightweight version of the server directly from command-line (no server.cfg required) for testing plugins.

## Libraries

* ***[SA:MP stdlib](https://github.com/pawn-lang/samp-stdlib/)*** - Updated versions of the default includes.  `const`-correct, documented, and complete.
