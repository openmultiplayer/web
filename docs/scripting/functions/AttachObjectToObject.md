## Description

You can use this function to attach objects to other objects. The objects will folow the main object.

| Name          | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectid      | The object to attach to another object.                                 |
| attachtoid    | The object to attach the object to.                                     |
| Float:OffsetX | The distance between the main object and the object in the X direction. |
| Float:OffsetY | The distance between the main object and the object in the Y direction. |
| Float:OffsetZ | The distance between the main object and the object in the Z direction. |
| Float:RotX    | The X rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| Float:RotY    | The Y rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| Float:RotZ    | The Z rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| SyncRotation  | If set to 0, objectid's rotation will not change with attachtoid's.     |

## Returns

1: The function executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the first object (objectid) does not exist. There are no internal checks to verify that the second object (attachtoid) exists.

## Examples

```c
new gObjectId = CreateObject(...);
new gAttachToId = CreateObject(...);

AttachObjectToObject(gObjectId, gAttachToId, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1);
```

## Notes

:::tip

Both objects need to be [created](CreateObject) before attempting to attach them. There is no player-object version of this function (AttachPlayerObjectToObject), meaning it will not be supported by streamers.
