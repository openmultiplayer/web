| Name              | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectid          | The object to attach to another object.                                   |
| parentid          | The object to attach the object to.                                       |
| Float:offsetX     | The distance between the main object and the object in the X direction.   |
| Float:offsetY     | The distance between the main object and the object in the Y direction.   |
| Float:offsetZ     | The distance between the main object and the object in the Z direction.   |
| Float:rotationX   | The X rotation between the object and the main object.                    |
| Float:rotationY   | The Y rotation between the object and the main object.                    |
| Float:rotationZ   | The Z rotation between the object and the main object.                    |
| bool:syncRotation | If set to `false`, objectid's rotation will not change with attachtoid's. |

## Returns

**true** - The function executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. This means the first object (objectid) does not exist. There are no internal checks to verify that the second object (attachtoid) exists.

## Examples

```c
new gObjectId = CreateObject(...);
new gAttachToId = CreateObject(...);

AttachObjectToObject(gObjectId, gAttachToId, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, true);
```

## Notes

:::tip

Both objects need to be created before attempting to attach them. 

:::

:::tip

There is no player-object version of this function in SA-MP.

But there is [AttachPlayerObjectToObject](AttachPlayerObjectToObject) in open.mp
