    // This example shows a large, white text saying "[playerName] has
    // passed away" on everyone's screen, after a player has died or
    // has been killed. It shows in text-type 3, for 5 seconds (5000 ms)
    new name[ 24 ], string[ 64 ];
    GetPlayerName( playerid, name, 24 );

    // Format the passed-away message properly, and show it to everyone:

    GameTextForAll( string, 5000, 3 );

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Do note that the players may crash because of odd number of tilde (~) symbols used in the game text. Using color codes (e.g. ~r~) beyond the 255th character may crash the client.
