## Examples

```c
// On top of our script, declaring a global variable
new
    gVehicleAlarmTimer[MAX_VEHICLES] = {0, ...};

// If setting a single parameter, you should obtain the current parameters so they aren't ALL changed
new
    engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective;

// Somewhere where you create the vehicle..
GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
SetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective); // ONLY the engine param was changed to VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON (1)

// The function
SetVehicleParamsEx_Fixed(vehicleid, &engine, &lights, &alarm, &doors, &bonnet, &boot, &objective)
{
    SetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
    if (alarm)
    {
        // Kill the timer, reset the timer identifier and then restart it if it was already running
        KillTimer(gVehicleAlarmTimer[vehicleid]);
        gVehicleAlarmTimer[vehicleid] = 0;
        gVehicleAlarmTimer[vehicleid] = SetTimerEx("DisableVehicleAlarm", 20000, false, "d", vehicleid);
    }
}

forward DisableVehicleAlarm(vehicleid);
public DisableVehicleAlarm(vehicleid)
{
    new
        engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective;

    GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
    if (alarm == VEHICLE_PARAMS_ON)
    {
        SetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, VEHICLE_PARAMS_OFF, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
    }

    // Reset the timer identifier
    gVehicleAlarmTimer[vehicleid] = 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

The alarm will not reset when finished, you'll need to reset it by yourself with this function. Lights also operate during the day (Only when ManualVehicleEngineAndLights is enabled).
