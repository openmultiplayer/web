## Description

Get the ping of a player. The ping measures the amount of time it takes for the server to 'ping' the client and for the client to send the message back.

| Name     | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| playerid | The ID of the player to get the ping of. |

## Returns

The current ping of the player (expressed in milliseconds).

## Examples

```c
// Declare an array of all possible timer identifiers for timers for kicking players with
// generally high ping with default value of 0
new
    gPlayerPingTimer[MAX_PLAYERS] = {0, ...};

// A constant (nice documentation :))
const
    MAX_ACCEPTED_PING = 500;

public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    // Initiate the timer and assign the variable the identifier of the timer
    gPlayerPingTimer[playerid] = SetTimerEx("Ping_Timer", 3 * 1000, true, "i", playerid);
}

public OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid, reason)
{
    // Kill the timer and reset the value to invalid
    KillTimer(gPlayerPingTimer[playerid]);
    gPlayerPingTimer[playerid] = 0;
}

// A forwarded function (callback)
forward public Ping_Timer(playerid);
public Ping_Timer(playerid)
{
    // Kick player if their ping is more than the generally accepted high ping
    if (GetPlayerPing(playerid) > MAX_ACCEPTED_PING)
    {
        SendClientMessageToAll()
        Kick(playerid);
    }
    return 1;
}
```
