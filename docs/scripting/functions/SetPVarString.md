## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    new 
        hours, 
        minutes, 
        seconds, 
        string[46];

    gettime(hours, minutes, seconds); // get the time
    format(string, sizeof(string), "Connected on %02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds); // create the string with the connect time
    SetPVarString(playerid, "timeconnected", string); // save the string into a player variable

    // PRO TIP: You don't need `format` in open.mp
    SetPVarString(playerid, "timeconnected", "Connected on %02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after [OnPlayerDisconnect](../callbacks/OnPlayerDisconnect) is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
