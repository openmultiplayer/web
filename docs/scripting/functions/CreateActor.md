## Description

Create a static 'actor' in the world. These 'actors' are like NPCs, however they have limited functionality. They do not take up server player slots.

| Name        | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| skin        | The [model ID](../resources/skins) the actor should have. |
| Float:x     | The X coordinate to create the actor at.                  |
| Float:y     | The Y coordinate to create the actor at.                  |
| Float:z     | The Z coordinate to create the actor at.                  |
| Float:angle | The facing angle (rotation) for the actor to have.        |

## Returns

The created Actor ID (start at 0).

INVALID_ACTOR_ID (65535) If the actor limit (1000) is reached.

## Examples

```c
new gActorCJ;

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Create an actor (CJ) at Blueberry Acres (Center of SA map)
    gActorCJ = CreateActor(0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0);
}

public OnGameModeExit()
{
    // Destroy our lovely actor (CJ)
    DestroyActor(gActorCJ);
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Actors are designed to just stand somewhere, for example cashiers and bartenders. They can perform animations (once or looping) using [ApplyActorAnimation](ApplyActorAnimation).

:::

:::warning

- Actors are completely separate from NPCs. They do NOT use player IDs/slots on the server and CANNOT be handled like NPCs. Actors are limited to 1000 (MAX_ACTORS).
- Actors can be pushed by vehicles, use a timer to put them back at their positions.
- Actors default to being invulnerable.
