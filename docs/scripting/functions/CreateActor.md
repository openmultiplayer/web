## Description

Create a static 'actor' in the world. These 'actors' are like NPCs, however they have limited functionality. They do not take up server player slots.

| Name     | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| modelid  | The model ID (skin ID) the actor should have.      |
| x        | The X coordinate to create the actor at.           |
| y        | The Y coordinate to create the actor at.           |
| z        | The Z coordinate to create the actor at.           |
| Rotation | The facing angle (rotation) for the actor to have. |

## Returns

The created Actor ID (start at 0).

INVALID_ACTOR_ID (65535) If the actor limit (1000) is reached.

## Examples

```c
new gActorCJ;

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Create an actor (CJ) at Blueberry Acres (Center of SA map)
    gActorCJ = CreateActor(0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0);
}

public OnGameModeExit()
{
    // Destroy our lovely actor (CJ)
    DestroyActor(gActorCJ);
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Actors are designed to just stand somewhere, for example cashiers and bartenders. They can perform animations (once or looping) using ApplyActorAnimation.

:::

:::warning

Actors are completely separate from NPCs. They do NOT use player IDs/slots on the server and CANNOT be handled like NPCs. Actors are limited to 1000 (MAX_ACTORS). Actors can be pushed by vehicles, use a timer to put them back at their positions. As of 0.3.7 R2 actors default to being invulnerable.
