## Returns

1: The function was executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the player is not connected.

## Examples

```c
// player punching sound (fits for commands such as /slap well). The sound will be quiet, as the source is actually 10 meters above the player.
PlayerPlaySound(playerid, 1130, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0);
```

## Notes

:::tip

Only use the coordinates if you want the sound to be played at a certain position. Set coordinates all to 0.0 to just play the sound.
