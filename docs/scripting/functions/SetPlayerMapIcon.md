## Returns

`true` - The function executed successfully.

`false` - The function failed to execute. Player is not connected.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    // This example demonstrates how to create a dollar-icon on top of a 24/7 located
    // in Las Venturas. This way new players know where to go with their money!
    SetPlayerMapIcon(playerid, 12, 2204.9468, 1986.2877, 16.7380, 52, 0, MAPICON_LOCAL);
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

If you use an invalid marker type, it will create ID 1 (White Square). If you use an icon ID that is already in use, it will replace the current map icon using that ID.

:::

:::warning

You can only have 100 map icons! Marker type 1 (![](/images/mapIcons/icon1.gif)), 2 (![](/images/mapIcons/icon2.gif)), 4 (![](/images/mapIcons/icon4.gif)), and 56 (![](/images/mapIcons/icon56.gif)) will cause your game to crash if you have map legends enabled while viewing the map.
