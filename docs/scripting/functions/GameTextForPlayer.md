| Name             | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| playerid         | The ID of the player to show the gametext for.                    |
| const format[]   | The text to be displayed.                                         |
| time             | The duration of the text being shown in milliseconds.             |

## Returns

**true** - The function executed successfully. Success is reported when the style and/or time is invalid. Nothing will happen though (no text displayed). May also cause game crashes.

**false** - The function failed to execute. This means either the string is null or the player is not connected.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, WEAPON:reason)
{
    GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "Wasted", 5000, 2);

    if (killerid != INVALID_PLAYER_ID)
    {
        new name[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
        GetPlayerName(playerid, name, sizeof(name));

        GameTextForPlayer(killerid, "~w~You killed ~r~%s", 3000, 3, name);
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Do note that the players may crash because of odd number of tilde (~) symbols used in the game text. Using color codes (e.g. ~r~) beyond the 255th character may crash the client.

Also, a blank space at end of the string may result in faliure. For example: `"Headshot "` results in failure. Instead it should be `"Headshot"` or `"Headshot_"`.
