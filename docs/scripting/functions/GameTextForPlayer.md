## Description

Shows 'game text' (on-screen text) for a certain length of time for a specific player.

| Name           | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid       | The ID of the player to show the gametext for.                    |
| const string[] | The text to be displayed.                                         |
| time           | The duration of the text being shown in milliseconds.             |
| style          | The [style](../resources/gametextstyles) of text to be displayed. |

## Returns

1: The function executed successfully. Success is reported when the style and/or time is invalid. Nothing will happen though (no text displayed). May also cause game crashes.

0: The function failed to execute. This means either the string is null or the player is not connected.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, reason)
{
    GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "Wasted", 5000, 2);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Do note that the players may crash because of odd number of tilde (~) symbols used in the game text. Using color codes (e.g. ~r~) beyond the 255th character may crash the client.

Also, a blank space at end of the string may result in faliure. For example: `"Headshot "` results in failure. Instead it should be `"Headshot"` or `"Headshot_"`.
