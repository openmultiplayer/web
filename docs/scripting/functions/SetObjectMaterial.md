            myObject;

        GetPlayerPos(playerid, X, Y, Z);
        myObject = CreateObject(19371, X, Y, Z+0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 300.0);
        SetObjectMaterial(myObject, 0, 19341, "egg_texts", "easter_egg01", 0xFFFFFFFF);

## Notes

:::tip

Vertex lighting of the object will disappear if material color is changed.
