    if (killerid != INVALID_PLAYER_ID)
    {
        // The WEAPON_MINIGUN constant is pre-defined in the standard library and is equal to 38.
        if (GetPlayerWeapon(killerid) == WEAPON_MINIGUN)
        {
            //Ban if they have a minigun
            Ban(killerid);
        }

    return 1;
}

## Notes

:::tip

When the player state is PLAYER_STATE_DRIVER or PLAYER_STATE_PASSENGER this function returns the weapon held by the player before they entered the vehicle. If a cheat is used to spawn a weapon inside a vehicle, this function will not report it.

:::

:::warning

Sometimes the result can be -1 which is an invalid weapon ID. Circumstances of this are not yet known, but it is best to discard information when returned weapon is -1.
