## Returns

1: The function executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the player specified does not exist.

## Examples

```c
//from Yagu's race filterscript, (c) by Yagu
public SetRaceCheckpoint(playerid, Airrace, target, next)
{
     if (next == -1 && Airrace == 0)
         SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid,1,RaceCheckpoints[target][0],RaceCheckpoints[target][1],RaceCheckpoints[target][2],
                         0.0,0.0,0.0,CPsize);
     else if (next == -1 && Airrace == 1)
         SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid,4,RaceCheckpoints[target][0],RaceCheckpoints[target][1],RaceCheckpoints[target][2],
                         0.0,0.0,0.0,CPsize);
     else if (Airrace == 1)
         SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid,3,RaceCheckpoints[target][0],RaceCheckpoints[target][1],RaceCheckpoints[target][2],
                         RaceCheckpoints[next][0],RaceCheckpoints[next][1],RaceCheckpoints[next][2],CPsize);
     else
         SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid,0,RaceCheckpoints[target][0],RaceCheckpoints[target][1],RaceCheckpoints[target][2],
                         RaceCheckpoints[next][0],RaceCheckpoints[next][1],RaceCheckpoints[next][2],CPsize);
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Race checkpoints are asynchronous, meaning only one can be shown at a time. To 'stream' race checkpoints (only show them when players are close enough), use a race checkpoint streamer.
