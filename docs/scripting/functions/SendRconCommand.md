## Examples

```c
SendRconCommand("gmx");
// This is a scripted version of typing "/rcon gmx" in-game.
// GMX restarts the game mode.

// Example using format()
new szMapName[] = "Los Santos";
new szCmd[64];
format(szCmd, sizeof(szCmd), "mapname %s", szMapName);
SendRconCommand(szCmd);

// PRO TIP: You don't need `format` in open.mp
SendRconCommand("mapname %s", szMapName);
```
