## Description

You can use this function to attach player-objects to other player-objects. The objects will follow the main object.

| Name              | Description                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| playerid          | The ID of the player.                                                   |
| objectid          | The player-object to attach to another player-object.                   |
| parentid          | The object to attach the object to.                                     |
| Float:OffsetX     | The distance between the main object and the object in the X direction. |
| Float:OffsetY     | The distance between the main object and the object in the Y direction. |
| Float:OffsetZ     | The distance between the main object and the object in the Z direction. |
| Float:RotX        | The X rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| Float:RotY        | The Y rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| Float:RotZ        | The Z rotation between the object and the main object.                  |
| bool:syncRotation | If set to `false`, objectid's rotation will not change with parentid's. |

## Returns

`true` - The function executed successfully.

`false` - The function failed to execute. This means the first object (objectid) does not exist. There are no internal checks to verify that the second object (parentid) exists.

## Examples

```c
new objectid = CreatePlayerObject(...);
new parentid = CreatePlayerObject(...);

AttachPlayerObjectToObject(playerid, objectid, parentid, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, true);
```

## Notes

:::tip

Both objects need to be created before attempting to attach them.
