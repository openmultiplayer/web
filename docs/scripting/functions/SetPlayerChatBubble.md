    return 1;

## Notes

:::tip

You can't see your own chat bubbles. The same applies to attached 3D text labels.

:::

:::tip

You can use color embedding for multiple colors in the message. Using '-1' as the color will make the text white (for the simple reason that -1, when represented in hexadecimal notation, is 0xFFFFFFFF).
