new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read),

	// Initialize "buf"
	buf[128];

// Check, if the file is opened
if(handle)
{
	// Success

	// Read the whole file
	while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

	// Close the file
	fclose(handle);
}
else
{
	// Error
	print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
// Open "file.txt" in "read and write" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt"),

	// Initialize "buf"
	buf[128];

// Check, if file is open
if(handle)
{
	// Success

	// Read the whole file
	while(fread(handle, buf)) print(buf);

	// Set the file pointer to the first byte
	fseek(handle, _, seek_begin);

	// Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
	fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

	// Close the file
	fclose(handle);
}
