## Returns

1: The function was executed successfully. Note that success is reported if the player is not in spectator mode (TogglePlayerSpectating), but nothing will happen. TogglePlayerSpectating MUST be used first.

0: The function failed to execute. The player, vehicle, or both don't exist.

## Examples

```c
TogglePlayerSpectating(playerid, 1);
PlayerSpectateVehicle(playerid, vehicleid);
```

## Notes

:::warning

Order is CRITICAL! Ensure that you use TogglePlayerSpectating before PlayerSpectateVehicle. The playerid and vehicleid have to be in the same interior and virtual world for this function to work properly.
