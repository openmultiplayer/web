## Description

Creates an explosion that is only visible to a single player. This can be used to isolate explosions from other players or to make them only appear in specific virtual worlds.

| Name         | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid     | The ID of the player to create the explosion for.        |
| Float:X      | The X coordinate of the explosion.                       |
| Float:Y      | The Y coordinate of the explosion.                       |
| Float:Z      | The Z coordinate of the explosion.                       |
| type         | The [type](../resources/explosionlist) of the explosion. |
| Float:radius | The radius of the explosion.                             |

## Returns

This function always returns 1, even if the function failed to excute (player doesn't exist, invalid radius, or invalid explosion type).

## Examples

```c
if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/burnme", true) == 0)
{
    new Float: playerPos[3];
    GetPlayerPos(playerid, playerPos[0], playerPos[1], playerPos[2]);
    CreateExplosionForPlayer(playerid, playerPos[0], playerPos[1], playerPos[2], 1, 10.0);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

There is a limit as to how many explosions can be seen at once by a player. This is roughly 10.
