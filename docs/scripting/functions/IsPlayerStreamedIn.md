| Name        | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid    | The ID of the player to check is streamed in.                 |
| forplayerid | The ID of the player to check if playerid is streamed in for. |

## Returns

1: The player is streamed in.

0: The player is not streamed in.

## Examples

```c
if (IsPlayerStreamedIn(playerid, 0))
{
	SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "ID 0 can see you.");
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Players stream out if they are more than 150 meters away (see server.cfg - stream_distance)

:::

:::warning

Players aren't streamed in on their own client, so if playerid is the same as forplayerid it will return false!
