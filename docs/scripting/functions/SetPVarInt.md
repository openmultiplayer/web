## Examples

```c
// set GetPlayerMoney the value of player variable named "Money"
SetPVarInt(playerid, "Money", GetPlayerMoney(playerid));

// will print money that player has
printf("money: %d", GetPVarInt(playerid, "Money"));
```

## Notes

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after [OnPlayerDisconnect](../callbacks/OnPlayerDisconnect) is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
