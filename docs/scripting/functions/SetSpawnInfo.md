## Description

This function can be used to change the spawn information of a specific player. It allows you to automatically set someone's spawn weapons, their team, skin and spawn position, normally used in case of minigames or automatic-spawn systems. This function is more crash-safe then using SetPlayerSkin in [OnPlayerSpawn](../callbacks/OnPlayerSpawn) and/or [OnPlayerRequestClass](../callbacks/OnPlayerRequestClass), even though this has been fixed in 0.2.

## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerRequestClass(playerid, classid)
{
    // This simple example demonstrates how to spawn every player automatically with
    // CJ's skin, which is number 0. The player will spawn in Las Venturas, with
    // 36 Sawnoff-Shotgun rounds and 150 Tec9 rounds.
    SetSpawnInfo( playerid, NO_TEAM, 0, 1958.33, 1343.12, 15.36, 269.15, 26, 36, 28, 150, 0, 0 );
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

In case you don't need to set a team to the player, make sure that the "team" parameter is set to NO_TEAM (255).
Team ID 0 in open.mp is a valid team while in SA-MP it is not (SA-MP bug).
