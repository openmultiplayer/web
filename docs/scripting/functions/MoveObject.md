## Description

Move an object to a new position with a set speed. Players/vehicles will 'surf' the object as it moves.

| Name        | Description                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectid    | The ID of the object to move.                             |
| Float:X     | The X coordinate to move the object to.                   |
| Float:Y     | The Y coordinate to move the object to.                   |
| Float:Z     | The Z coordinate to move the object to.                   |
| Float:Speed | The speed at which to move the object (units per second). |
| Float:RotX  | The FINAL X rotation (optional).                          |
| Float:RotY  | The FINAL Y rotation (optional).                          |
| Float:RotZ  | The FINAL Z rotation (optional).                          |

## Returns

The time it will take for the object to move in milliseconds.

## Examples

```c
new gAirportGate; // Somewhere at the top of your script

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    gAirportGate = CreateObject(980, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/moveobject", true) == 0)
    {
        new
            string[50],
            moveTime = MoveObject(gAirportGate, 0.0, 0.0, 10.0, 2.00);

        format(string, sizeof(string), "Object will finish moving in %d milliseconds", moveTime);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFF000000, string);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

- This function can be used to make objects rotate smoothly. In order to achieve this however, the object must also be **moved**. The specified rotation is the rotation the object will have after the movement. Hence the object will not rotate when no movement is applied. For a script example take a look at the ferriswheel.pwn filterscript made by Kye included in the server package (SA-MP 0.3d and above).

- To fully understand the above note, you can (but not limited to) increase the z position by (+0.001) and then (-0.001) after moving it again, as not changing the X,Y or Z will not rotate the object.
