## Description

Get the cosine from a given angle. The input angle may be in radians, degrees or grades.

| Name        | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Float:value | The angle from which to get the cosine.                |
| anglemode   | The [angle mode](../resources/anglemodes) to use, depending on the value entered. |

## Returns

The cosine of the value entered.

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    printf("The cosine from 90° is %f", floatcos(90.0, degrees));
    // Output: 0
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

GTA/SA-MP use degrees for angles in most circumstances, for example [GetPlayerFacingAngle](GetPlayerFacingAngle). Therefore, it is most likely you'll want to use the 'degrees' angle mode, not radians. Also note that angles in GTA are counterclockwise; 270° is East and 90° is West. South is still 180° and North still 0°/360°.
