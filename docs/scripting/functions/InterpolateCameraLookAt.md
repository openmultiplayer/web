```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp(cmdtext, "/rotateme", true))
    {
        TogglePlayerSpectating(playerid, 1);
        InterpolateCameraLookAt(playerid, 50.0, 50.0, 10.0, -50.0, 50.0, 10.0, 10000, CAMERA_MOVE);
        //                                 x1    y1    z1     x2    y2    z2
        // The camera starts off looking at (x1, y1, z1). It will then rotate and after
        // 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) it will be looking at (x2, y2, z2).
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Use TogglePlayerSpectating to make objects stream in for the player while the camera is moving. You can reset the camera behind the player with SetCameraBehindPlayer.
