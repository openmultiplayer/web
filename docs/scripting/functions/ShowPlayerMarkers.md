## Returns

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Player markers only visible to nearby players
    ShowPlayerMarkers(PLAYER_MARKERS_MODE_STREAMED);
}
```

## Marker Modes

| ID  | MODE                         |
| --- | ---------------------------- |

## Notes

:::tip

It is also possible to set a player's color to a color that has full transparency (no alpha value). This makes it possible to show markers on a per-player basis.
