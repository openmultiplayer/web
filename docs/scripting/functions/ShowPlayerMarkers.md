| mode | The mode to use for markers. They can be streamed, meaning they are only visible to nearby players. See table below. |

## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Player markers only visible to nearby players
    ShowPlayerMarkers(PLAYER_MARKERS_MODE_STREAMED);
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

It is also possible to set a player's color to a color that has full transparency (no alpha value). This makes it possible to show markers on a per-player basis.
