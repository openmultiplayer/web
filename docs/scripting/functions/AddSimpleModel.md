## Notes

:::tip

`useartwork` must be enabled first in server settings in order for this to work When virtualworld is set, the models will be downloaded once the player enters the specific world

:::

:::warning

There are currently no restrictions on when you can call this function, but be aware that if you do not call them inside [OnFilterScriptInit](../callbacks/OnFilterScriptInit)/[OnGameModeInit](../callbacks/OnGameModeInit), you run the risk that some players, who are already on the server, may not have downloaded the models.
