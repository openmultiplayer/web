## Examples

```c
new objectid = CreateObject(19371, 978.71143, -925.25708, 42.63720,   0.00000, 0.00000, 2.00000);
SetObjectMaterial(objectid, 0, 19341, "egg_texts", "easter_egg01", 0xFFFFFFFF);

new 
    modelid,
    textureLibrary[16],
    textureName[16],
    materialColour;

GetObjectMaterial(objectid, 0, modelid, textureLibrary, sizeof(textureLibrary), textureName, sizeof(textureName), materialColour);
// modelid = 19341
// textureLibrary = "egg_texts"
// textureName = "easter_egg01"
// materialColour = 0xFFFFFFFF
