## Returns

The time it will take for the object to move in milliseconds.

## Examples

```c
MovePlayerObject(playerid, objectid, 2001.195679, 1547.113892, 10);
```

## Notes

:::tip

If using the rotation parameters, the object must be moved (X/Y/Z). The object will interpolate the rotation from when the objects starts moving and when it stops.
