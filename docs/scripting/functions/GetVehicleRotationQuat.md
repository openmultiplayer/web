## Description

Returns a vehicle's rotation on all axes as a quaternion.

| Name      | Description                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| vehicleid | The ID of the vehicle to get the rotation of.                                        |
| &Float:w  | A float variable in which to store the first quaternion angle, passed by reference.  |
| &Float:x  | A float variable in which to store the second quaternion angle, passed by reference. |
| &Float:y  | A float variable in which to store the third quaternion angle, passed by reference.  |
| &Float:z  | A float variable in which to store the fourth quaternion angle, passed by reference. |

## Returns

1: The function was executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the vehicle specified does not exist.

The vehicle's rotation is stored in the specified variables.

## Notes

:::tip

There is no 'set' variation of this function; you can not SET a vehicle's rotation (apart from the Z angle) This function may return incorrect values for unoccupied vehicles. The reason is that the third row of the vehicle's internal rotation matrix gets corrupted if it gets updated while unoccupied.
