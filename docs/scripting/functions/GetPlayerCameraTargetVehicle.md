    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

This function can (obviously) only return one vehicle ID at a time, while the player may be looking at multiple. It generally seems to detect the closest vehicle first.

:::warning

This function is disabled by default to save bandwidth. Use [EnablePlayerCameraTarget](EnablePlayerCameraTarget) to enable it for each player.
