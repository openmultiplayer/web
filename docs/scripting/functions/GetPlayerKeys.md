    new
        KEY:keys, updown, leftright;

    GetPlayerKeys(playerid, keys, updown, leftright);

    if (updown == KEY_UP)

        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "UP");

    else if (updown == KEY_DOWN)
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "DOWN");
    }

    if (leftright == KEY_LEFT)
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "LEFT");
    }
    else if (leftright == KEY_RIGHT)
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "RIGHT");
    }

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Only the FUNCTION of keys can be detected; not actual keys. For example, it is not possible to detect if a player presses SPACE, but you can detect if they press SPRINT (which can be mapped (assigned/binded) to ANY key (but is space by default)).

As of update 0.3.7, the keys "A" and "D" are not recognized when in a vehicle. However, keys "W" and "S" can be detected with the "keys" parameter.
