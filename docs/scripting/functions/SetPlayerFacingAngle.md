## Returns

**true** - The function executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. The player specified does not exist.

## Examples

```c
SetPlayerFacingAngle(playerid, 0.0); //Player faces north
```

```
        north (0)
           |
(90) west-   -east (270)      (Good way to remember: Never Eat Shredded Wheat)
           |
        south (180)
```

## Notes

:::warning

Angles are reversed in GTA:SA; 90 degrees would be East in the real world, but in GTA:SA 90 degrees is in fact West. North and South are still 0/360 and 180. To convert this, simply do 360 - angle.
