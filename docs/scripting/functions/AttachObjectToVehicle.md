## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

```c
new objectid = CreateObject(...);
new vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid);
AttachObjectToVehicle(objectid, vehicleid, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
```

## Notes

:::tip

The object must be created first.

:::

:::warning

When the vehicle is destroyed or respawned, the attached objects won't be destroyed with it; they will remain stationary at the position the vehicle disappeared and be reattached to the next vehicle to claim the vehicle ID that the objects were attached to.
