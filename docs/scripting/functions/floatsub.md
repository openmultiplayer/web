## Description

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| oper1 | First Float.                                         |
| oper2 | Second Float (gets subtracted from the first float.) |

## Returns

The difference of the two given floats.

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    new Float:Number1 = 5, Float:Number2 = 2; //Declares two floats, Number1 (5) and Number2 (2)
    new Float:Difference;
    Difference = floatsub(Number1, Number2);//Saves the Difference(5-2 = 3) of Number1 and Number2 in the float "Difference"
    return 1;
}
