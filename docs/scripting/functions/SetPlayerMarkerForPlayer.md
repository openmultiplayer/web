## Examples

```c
// Make player 42 see player 1 as a red marker
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer(42, 1, 0xFF0000FF);

// Make the players marker an invisible white (chat will be white but marker will be gone).
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer(42, 1, 0xFFFFFF00);

// Make the players marker invisible to the player while keeping chat colour the same. Will only work correctly if SetPlayerColor has been used:
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer(42, 1, (GetPlayerColor(1) & 0xFFFFFF00));

// Make the players marker fully opaque (solid) to the player while keeping chat colour the same. Will only work correctly if SetPlayerColor has been used:
SetPlayerMarkerForPlayer(42, 1, (GetPlayerColor(1) | 0x000000FF));
