SetPlayerObjectMaterial(playerid, playerobjectid, 0, 19341, "egg_texts", "easter_egg01", 0xFFFFFFFF);

new 
    modelid,
    textureLibrary[16],
    textureName[16],
    materialColour;

GetPlayerObjectMaterial(playerid, playerobjectid, 0, modelid, textureLibrary, sizeof(textureLibrary), textureName, sizeof(textureName), materialColour);
// modelid = 19341
// textureLibrary = "egg_texts"
