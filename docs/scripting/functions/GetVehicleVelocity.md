| &Float:x  | A float variable in to which to store the vehicle's X velocity, passed by reference. |
| &Float:y  | A float variable in to which to store the vehicle's Y velocity, passed by reference. |
| &Float:z  | A float variable in to which to store the vehicle's Z velocity, passed by reference. |

## Returns

1: The function was executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the vehicle specified does not exist.

The vehicle's velocity is stored in the specified variables.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp("/GetMyCarVelocity", cmdtext) && IsPlayerInAnyVehicle(playerid))
    {
        new
            Float: vehVelocity[3],
            clientMessage[80];

        GetVehicleVelocity(GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid), vehVelocity[0], vehVelocity[1], vehVelocity[2]);
        format(clientMessage, sizeof(clientMessage), "You are going at a velocity of X%f, Y%f, Z%f", vehVelocity[0], vehVelocity[1], vehVelocity[2]);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, clientMessage);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
