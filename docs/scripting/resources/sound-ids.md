title: Sound IDs
description: A list of sound IDs used by PlayerPlaySound.
---

Here you can find all of the sound IDs used by [PlayerPlaySound](../functions/PlayerPlaySound) function.

For [crime report sound IDs](../functions/PlayCrimeReportForPlayer) check [here](crimelist).

:::note

You have to use sound ID **0** to stop the sound ID that is currently playing.

:::

:::caution Since **0.3.7-R2**:

- Sound ID **1** can be used to disable the [interior 0 (default)](../functions/SetPlayerInterior) ambience track (wind noise). _Hint: it can help to create more realistically fake interiors._
- Sound ID **0** can be used additionally to return the game's normal outdoor ambience track.
