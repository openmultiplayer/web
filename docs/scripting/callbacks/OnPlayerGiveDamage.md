| playerid  | The ID of the player that gave damage.                                                                                                  |
| damagedid | The ID of the player that received damage.                                                                                              |
| amount    | The amount of health/armour damagedid has lost (combined).                                                                              |

| bodypart  | The [body part](../resources/bodyparts) that was hit. (NOTE: This parameter was added in 0.3z. Leave it out if using an older version!) |

## Returns

1 - 回调不会在其他过滤脚本中被调用。

0 -允许在其他筛选脚本中调用此回调。

它在过滤脚本中总是先被调用，所以在那里返回 1 会阻止其他过滤脚本看到它。

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerGiveDamage(playerid, damagedid, Float:amount, weaponid, bodypart)
{
    new string[128], victim[MAX_PLAYER_NAME], attacker[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
    new weaponname[24];
    GetPlayerName(playerid, attacker, sizeof (attacker));
    GetPlayerName(damagedid, victim, sizeof (victim));

    GetWeaponName(weaponid, weaponname, sizeof (weaponname));
    format(string, sizeof(string), "%s has made %.0f damage to %s, weapon: %s, bodypart: %d", attacker, amount, victim, weaponname, bodypart);
    SendClientMessageToAll(0xFFFFFFFF, string);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Keep in mind this function can be inaccurate in some cases. If you want to prevent certain players from damaging eachother, use SetPlayerTeam. The weaponid will return 37 (flame thrower) from any fire sources (e.g. molotov, 18) The weaponid will return 51 from any weapon that creates an explosion (e.g. RPG, grenade) playerid is the only one who can call the callback. The amount is always the maximum damage the weaponid can do, even when the health left is less than that maximum damage. So when a player has 100.0 health and gets shot with a Desert Eagle which has a damage value of 46.2, it takes 3 shots to kill that player. All 3 shots will show an amount of 46.2, even though when the last shot hits, the player only has 7.6 health left.
