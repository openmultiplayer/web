## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerClickPlayer(playerid, clickedplayerid, source)
{
    new message[32];
    format(message, sizeof(message), "You clicked on player %d", clickedplayerid);
    SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, message);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

There is currently only one 'source' (0 - CLICK_SOURCE_SCOREBOARD). The existence of this argument suggests that more sources may be supported in the future.
