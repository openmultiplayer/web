## Description

This callback is called when a player's client updates/syncs the position of a vehicle they're not driving. This can happen outside of the vehicle or when the player is a passenger of a vehicle that has no driver.

## Returns

It is always called first in filterscripts so returning 0 there also blocks other scripts from seeing it.

## Examples

```c
public OnUnoccupiedVehicleUpdate(vehicleid, playerid, passenger_seat, Float:new_x, Float:new_y, Float:new_z, Float:vel_x, Float:vel_y, Float:vel_z)
{
    // Check if it moved far
    if (GetVehicleDistanceFromPoint(vehicleid, new_x, new_y, new_z) > 50.0)
    {
        // Reject the update
        return 0;
    }

    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

- This callback is called very frequently per second per unoccupied vehicle. You should refrain from implementing intensive calculations or intensive file writing/reading operations in this callback. 
- [GetVehiclePos](../functions/GetVehiclePos) will return the old coordinates of the vehicle before this update.
