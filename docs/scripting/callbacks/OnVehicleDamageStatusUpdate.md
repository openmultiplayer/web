{
    // Get the damage status of all the components
    new panels, doors, lights, tires;
    GetVehicleDamageStatus(vehicleid, panels, doors, lights, tires);

    // Set the tires to 0, which means none are popped
    tires = 0;

    // Update the vehicle's damage status with unpopped tires
    UpdateVehicleDamageStatus(vehicleid, panels, doors, lights, tires);
    return 1;
}
