| Name            | Description                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| playerid        | The ID of the player that gave damage.                |
| damaged_actorid | The ID of the actor that received damage.             |
| Float:amount    | The amount of health/armour damaged_actorid has lost. |
| WEAPON:weaponid | The reason that caused the damage.                    |
| bodypart        | The [body part](../resources/bodyparts) that was hit  |

## Returns

1 - Callback will not be called in other filterscripts.

0 - Allows this callback to be called in other filterscripts.

It is always called first in filterscripts so returning 1 there blocks other filterscripts from seeing it.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerGiveDamageActor(playerid, damaged_actorid, Float:amount, WEAPON:weaponid, bodypart)
{
    new string[128];
    new attackerName[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
    new weaponName[24];

    GetPlayerName(playerid, attackerName, sizeof (attackerName));
    GetWeaponName(weaponid, weaponName, sizeof (weaponName));

    format(string, sizeof(string), "%s has made %.0f damage to actor id %d, weapon: %s", attackerName, amount, damaged_actorid, weaponName);
    SendClientMessageToAll(0xFFFFFFFF, string);
    return 1;
}
```
