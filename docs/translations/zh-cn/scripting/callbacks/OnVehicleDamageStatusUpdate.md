```c
public OnVehicleDamageStatusUpdate(vehicleid, playerid)
{
    // Get the damage status of all the components
    new 
        VEHICLE_PANEL_STATUS:panels,
        VEHICLE_DOOR_STATUS:doors,
        VEHICLE_LIGHT_STATUS:lights,
        VEHICLE_TYRE_STATUS:tyres;

    GetVehicleDamageStatus(vehicleid, panels, doors, lights, tyres);

    // Set the tyres to 0, which means none are popped
    tyres = VEHICLE_TYRE_STATUS_NONE;

    // Update the vehicle's damage status with unpopped tyres
    UpdateVehicleDamageStatus(vehicleid, panels, doors, lights, tyres);
    return 1;
