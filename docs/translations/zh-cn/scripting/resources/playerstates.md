This page compiles the list of all the player states used by [GetPlayerState](../functions/GetPlayerState) function or [OnPlayerStateChange](../callbacks/OnPlayerStateChange) callback. Both pages contain examples on how to use the values below.

From a server developer standpoint having both "player states" and "special actions" may seem confusing. The main difference between the two is that the former is used for synchronization purposes (and there are packets associated with some of them), and is used for more "generic" actions. The "special actions" don't have any packets associated with them and cover more "specific" actions, and obviously have little to do with the current state of a player.
