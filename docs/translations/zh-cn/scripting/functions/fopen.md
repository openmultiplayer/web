| const filename[]                         | The path to the file to open (if just a filename is specified, it will open the file with the name specified in the 'scriptfiles' folder). |
| [filemode:mode](../resources/file-modes) | The mode to open the file with (default: io_readwrite).                                                                                    |

## Returns

Returns the file handle. This handle is used for reading and writing.

0 if failed to open file.

## Examples

**io_read mode:**

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_read);

// Initialize "buf"
new buf[128];

// Check, if the file is opened
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf))
    {
        print(buf);
    }

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```

<br />

**io_write mode:**

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "write only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_write);

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("Failed to open file \"file.txt\".");
}

```

<br />

**io_readwrite mode:**

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "read and write" mode

new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_readwrite);

// Initialize "buf"
new buf[128];

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Read the whole file
    while(fread(handle, buf))
    {
        print(buf);
    }

    // Set the file pointer to the first byte
    fseek(handle, _, seek_begin);

    // Write "I just wrote here!" into this file
    fwrite(handle, "I just wrote here!");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```

<br />

**io_append mode:**

```c
// Open "file.txt" in "append only" mode
new File:handle = fopen("file.txt", io_append);

// Check, if file is open
if (handle)
{
    // Success

    // Append "This is a text.\r\n"
    fwrite(handle, "This is a text.\r\n");

    // Close the file
    fclose(handle);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("Failed to open file \"file.txt\".");
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

If you use `io_read` and the file doesn't exist, it will return a NULL reference. Using invalid references on file functions will crash your server!
