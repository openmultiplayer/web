| level    | The level of drunkenness to set.                |

## Returns

**true** - The function executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. This means the player is not connected.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/drunk", true) == 0)
    {
        SetPlayerDrunkLevel(playerid, 4000);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFAA, "You are now drunk; don't drink and drive!");
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

- Players' drunk level will automatically decrease over time, based on their FPS (players with 50 FPS will lose 50 'levels' per second. This is useful for determining a player's FPS!).
- In 0.3a the drunk level will decrement and stop at 2000.
- In 0.3b+ the drunk level decrements to zero.
- Levels over 2000 make the player drunk (camera swaying and vehicles difficult to control).
- Max drunk level is 50000. While the drunk level is above 5000, the player's HUD (radar etc.) will be hidden.
