## Returns

**1:** The function executed successfully.

**0:** The function failed to execute.

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    AddSimpleModelTimed(-1, 19379, -2000, "wallzzz.dff", "wallzzz.txd", 9, 18); // This wall only renders from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

**useartwork** or **artwork.enable** must be enabled first in server settings in order for this to work.

When virtualworld is set, the models will be downloaded once the player enters the specific world.

:::

:::warning

There are currently no restrictions on when you can call this function, but be aware that if you do not call them inside [OnFilterScriptInit](../callbacks/OnFilterScriptInit)/[OnGameModeInit](../callbacks/OnGameModeInit), you run the risk that some players, who are already on the server, may not have downloaded the models.
