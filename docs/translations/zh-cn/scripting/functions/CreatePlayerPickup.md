## Notes

:::tip

- The only type of pickup that can be picked up from inside a vehicle is 14 (except for special pickups such as bribes).
- Pickups are shown to, and can be picked up by all players.
- It is possible that if DestroyPlayerPickup() is used when a pickup is picked up, more than one player can pick up the pickup, due to lag. This can be circumvented through the use of variables.
- Certain pickup types come with 'automatic responses', for example using an M4 model in the pickup will automatically give the player the weapon and some ammo.
- For fully scripted pickups, type 1 should be used.

:::

:::warning

Known Bug(s):

- Pickups that have a X or Y lower than -4096.0 or bigger than 4096.0 won't show up and won't trigger OnPlayerPickUpPlayerPickup either.
