| Name     | Description                                                                                         |

| id       | The virtual machine to use, you should keep this zero. *(optional=0)*                               |
| name[]   | The property's name, you should keep this "".                                                       |
| value    | The property's unique ID, Use the hash-function to calculate it from a string. *(optional=cellmin)* |
| string[] | The variable to store the result in, passed by reference.                                           |

## Returns

The value of a property when the name is passed in; fills in the string argument when the value is passed in. If the property does not exist, this function returns zero.

## Examples

```c
new value[16];

getproperty(0, "", 123984334, value);

strunpack(value, value, sizeof(value));

print(value);
```

## Notes

:::tip

It is recommended to use the PVars/SVars or GVar plugin instead of these natives for being very slow.
