## Description

Return the 32-bit CRC value of a file.

| Name             | Description           |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| const filename[] | The name of the file. |

## Returns

The 32-bit CRC value of the file, or **0** if the file cannot be opened.

## Examples

```c
new crc = filecrc("file.txt");

if (crc)
{
    // Success
    printf("CRC value = %d", crc);
}
else
{
    // Error
    print("The file \"file.txt\" does not exists, or can't be opened.");
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

- The CRC value is a useful measure to check whether the contents of a file has changed during transmission or whether it has been edited (provided that the CRC value of the original file was saved).
- The CRC value returned by this function is the same as the one used in ZIP archives (PKZip, WinZip) and the "SFV" utilities and file formats.
