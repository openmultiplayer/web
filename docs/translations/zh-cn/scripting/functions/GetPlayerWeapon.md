public OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, WEAPON:reason)
{
    // Check if the killerid is not an invalid player (which means is connected).
    if (killerid != INVALID_PLAYER_ID)
    {
        // The WEAPON_MINIGUN constant is pre-defined in the standard library and is equal to 38.
        if (GetPlayerWeapon(killerid) == WEAPON_MINIGUN)
        {
            //Ban if they have a minigun
            Ban(killerid);
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

When the player state is `PLAYER_STATE_DRIVER` or `PLAYER_STATE_PASSENGER` this function returns the weapon held by the player before they entered the vehicle. If a cheat is used to spawn a weapon inside a vehicle, this function will not report it.

:::

:::warning

Sometimes the result can be -1 which is an invalid weapon ID. Circumstances of this are not yet known, but it is best to discard information when returned weapon is -1.
