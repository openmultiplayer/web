## Returns

**true** - success

**false** - failure (invalid vehicle ID).

The vehicle's parameters are stored in the referenced variables, not in the return value.

## Examples

```c
new
	bool:engine, bool:lights, bool:alarm, bool:doors, bool:bonnet, bool:boot, bool:objective;
GetVehicleParamsEx(vehicleid, engine, lights, alarm, doors, bonnet, boot, objective);
//This would cause all the variable above, to become the status of its subject.
```

## Notes

:::tip

If a parameter is unset (SetVehicleParamsEx not used beforehand) the value will be -1 ('unset').
