| playerid     | The ID of the player whose player variable will be set. |
| const pvar[] | The name of the player variable.                        |
| Float:value  | The float you want to save in the player variable.      |

**true** - The function was executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. Either the player specified is not connected, or the variable name is null or over 40 characters.

## Examples

```c
SavePlayerPos(playerid)
{
    new Float:x, Float:y, Float:z;
    GetPlayerPos(playerid, x, y, z); // Get the players position

    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "Xpos", x); // Save the float into a player variable
    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "Ypos", y); // Save the float into a player variable
    SetPVarFloat(playerid, "Zpos", z); // Save the float into a player variable
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Variables aren't reset until after [OnPlayerDisconnect](../callbacks/OnPlayerDisconnect) is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
