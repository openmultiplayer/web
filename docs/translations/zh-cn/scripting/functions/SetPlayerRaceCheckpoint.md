|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| playerid      | The ID of the player to set the checkpoint for                 |
| CP_TYPE:type  | [Type of race checkpoint](../resources/race-checkpoint-types)  |
| Float:centreX | X-Coordinate                                                   |
| Float:centreY | Y-Coordinate                                                   |
| Float:centreZ | Z-Coordinate                                                   |
| Float:nextX   | X-Coordinate of the next point, for the arrow facing direction |
| Float:nextY   | Y-Coordinate of the next point, for the arrow facing direction |
| Float:nextZ   | Z-Coordinate of the next point, for the arrow facing direction |
| Float:radius  | Size (diameter) of the checkpoint                              |

## Returns

**true** - The function executed successfully.

**false** - The function failed to execute. This means the player specified does not exist.

## Examples

```c
SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid, CP_TYPE_GROUND_NORMAL, 644.3091, 1767.0223, 4.9970, 650.6734, 1812.0367, 4.9970, 3.0);
```

Another example:

```c
//from Yagu's race filterscript, (c) by Yagu
public SetRaceCheckpoint(playerid, Airrace, target, next)
{
    if (next == -1 && Airrace == 0)
    {
        SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid, CP_TYPE_GROUND_FINISH, RaceCheckpoints[target][0], RaceCheckpoints[target][1], RaceCheckpoints[target][2], 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, CPsize);
    }
    else if (next == -1 && Airrace == 1)
    {
        SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid, CP_TYPE_AIR_FINISH, RaceCheckpoints[target][0], RaceCheckpoints[target][1], RaceCheckpoints[target][2], 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, CPsize);
    }
    else if (Airrace == 1)
    {
        SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid, CP_TYPE_AIR_NORMAL, RaceCheckpoints[target][0], RaceCheckpoints[target][1], RaceCheckpoints[target][2], RaceCheckpoints[next][0], RaceCheckpoints[next][1], RaceCheckpoints[next][2], CPsize);
    }
    else
    {
        SetPlayerRaceCheckpoint(playerid, CP_TYPE_GROUND_NORMAL, RaceCheckpoints[target][0], RaceCheckpoints[target][1], RaceCheckpoints[target][2], RaceCheckpoints[next][0], RaceCheckpoints[next][1], RaceCheckpoints[next][2], CPsize);
    }
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

Race checkpoints are asynchronous, meaning only one can be shown at a time. To 'stream' race checkpoints (only show them when players are close enough), use a race checkpoint streamer.
