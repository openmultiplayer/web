        PlayerTextDrawShow(playerid, pVehicleHealthTD[playerid]);

        // Set a timer to update the textdraw every second

forward UpdateVehicleHealthTextDraw(playerid);
public UpdateVehicleHealthTextDraw(playerid)
{
    new 
        string[32],
        vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid),
        Float:health;

    GetVehicleHealth(vehicleid, health);

    format(string, sizeof(string), "Vehicle Health: %.0f", health);
    PlayerTextDrawSetString(playerid, pVehicleHealthTD[playerid], string); // <<< Update the text to show the vehicle health

    // PRO TIP: You don't need `format` in open.mp
