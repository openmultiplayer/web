if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/superman", true) == 0)
{
    SetPlayerName(playerid, "Superman");
    return 1;
}

// Command sets the players name to "Superman" if possible, informs the player of
// any errors using a "switch" statement.
if (strcmp(cmdtext, "/superman", true) == 0)
{
    switch (SetPlayerName(playerid, "Superman"))
    {
        case -1:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFF0000FF, "The name has invalid characters or it's out of length.");
        }
        case 0:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFF0000FF, "Unable to change your name, someone else is known as 'Superman' already.");
        }
        case 1:
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, 0x00FF00FF, "You are now known as 'Superman'");
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

- Changing the players' name to the same name but with different character cases (e.g. "John" to "JOHN") will not work.
- If used in [OnPlayerConnect](../callbacks/OnPlayerConnect), the new name will not be shown for the connecting player.
- Passing a null string as the new name will crash the server. (Fixed in open.mp)
- Player names can be up to 24 characters when using this function, but when joining the server from the SA-MP server browser, players' names must be no more than 20 and less than 3 characters (the server will deny entry). This allows for 4 characters extra when using SetPlayerName.
