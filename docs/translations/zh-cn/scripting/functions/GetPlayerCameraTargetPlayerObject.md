    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    if (!strcmp(cmdtext, "/check", true))
    {
        new objectid = GetPlayerCameraTargetPlayerObject(playerid);
        if (objectid == gPlayerObject[playerid])
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "You're looking at your object.");
        }
        else if (objectid == INVALID_OBJECT_ID) // INVALID_OBJECT_ID = 65535
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "You're not looking at any object.");
        }
        return 1;
