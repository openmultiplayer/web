## Description

Disable all the interior entrances and exits in the game (the yellow arrows at doors).

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    DisableInteriorEnterExits();
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::warning

This function will only work if it has been used BEFORE a player connects (it is recommended to use it in [OnGameModeInit](../callbacks/OnGameModeInit)). It will not remove a connected player's markers.

If the gamemode is changed after this function has been used, and the new gamemode doesn't disable markers, the markers will NOT reappear for already-connected players (but will for newly connected players).

:::

:::tip

You can also disable interior entrance markers via [config.json](../../server/config.json)

```json
"use_entry_exit_markers": false,
```
