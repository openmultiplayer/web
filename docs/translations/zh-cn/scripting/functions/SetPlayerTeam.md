## Returns

This function does not return any specific values.

## Examples

public OnPlayerSpawn(playerid)
{
    // Set a player's team to 4 when they spawn
    SetPlayerTeam(playerid, 4);
    return 1;
}

## Notes

:::tip

- Players can not damage/kill players on the same team unless they use a knife to slit their throat.

- Players are also unable to damage vehicles driven by a player from the same team. This can be enabled with [EnableVehicleFriendlyFire](EnableVehicleFriendlyFire).

- 255 (or `NO_TEAM`) is the default team to be able to shoot other players, not 0.
