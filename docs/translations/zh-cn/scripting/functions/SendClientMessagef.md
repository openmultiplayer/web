## Examples

```c
#define COLOR_RED 0xFF0000FF

public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
    new number = 5;
    SendClientMessagef(playerid, -1, "The variable above is %i", number);
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

You can use color embedding for multiple colors in the message. Using '-1' as the color will make the text white (for the simple reason that -1, when represented in hexadecimal notation, is 0xFFFFFFFF).

:::

:::warning

If a message is longer than 144 characters, it will not be sent. Truncation can be used to prevent this. Displaying a message on multiple lines will also solve this issue.
