| Float:oper1 | First Float.                                      |
| Float:oper2 | Second Float, the first one gets multiplied with. |

## Returns

The product of the two given floats

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    new Float:Number1 = 2.3, Float:Number2 = 3.5; // Declares two floats, Number1 (2.3) and Number2 (3.5)
    new Float:Product;
    Product = floatmul(Number1, Number2); // Saves the product(=2.3*3.5 = 8.05) of Number1 and Number2 in the float "Product"
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

This function is rather redundant, for it is no different than the conventional multiplication operator (\*).
