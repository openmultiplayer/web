## Description

Uses standard player walking animation (animation of the CJ skin) instead of custom animations for every skin (e.g. skating for skater skins).

## Examples

```c
public OnGameModeInit()
{
    UsePlayerPedAnims();
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

:::tip

Only works when placed under [OnGameModeInit](../callbacks/OnGameModeInit).

Not using this function causes two-handed weapons (not dual-handed - a single weapon that is held by both hands) to be held in only one hand.

:::

:::tip

You can also enable standard player walking animation via [config.json](../../server/config.json)

```json
"use_player_ped_anims": true,
```
