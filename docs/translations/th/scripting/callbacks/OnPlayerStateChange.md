## คำอธิบาย

This callback is called when a player changes state. For example, when a player changes from being the driver of a vehicle to being on-foot.

| Name     | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| playerid | The ID of the player that changed state. |
| newstate | The player's new state.                  |
| oldstate | The player's previous state.             |

Refer to [Player States](../../scripting/resources/playerstates.md) for a list of all available player states.
