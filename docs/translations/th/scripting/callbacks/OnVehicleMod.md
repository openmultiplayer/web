| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid    | The ID of the driver of the vehicle.                    |
| vehicleid   | The ID of the vehicle which is modded.                  |
| componentid | The ID of the component which was added to the vehicle. |

## ส่งคืน

It is always called first in gamemode so returning 0 there also blocks other filterscripts from seeing it.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
public OnVehicleMod(playerid, vehicleid, componentid)
{
    printf("Vehicle %d was modded by ID %d with the componentid %d",vehicleid, playerid,componentid);
    if (GetPlayerInterior(playerid) == 0)
    {
        BanEx(playerid, "Tuning Hacks"); // Anti-tuning hacks script
        return 0; // Prevents the bad modification from being synced to other players
        //(Tested and it works even on servers wich allow you to mod your vehicle using commands, menus, dialogs, etc..
    }
    return 1;
}
```
