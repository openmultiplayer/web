## คำอธิบาย

The following is a list of textdraw sprites (textures) that can be used in a
(player)textdraw (with [font](../functions/TextDrawFont) id 4) and shown to
players. To use a sprite, the [text](../functions/TextDrawCreate) of a textdraw
must be set according to a set format: `library:texture`. The extension `.txd`
need not be appended. Currently, only the libraries found in
`<SA Dir>/models/txd/` and `<SA Dir>/SAMP/` can be used.

## Libraries
