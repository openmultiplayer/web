The aspect ratio can be one of three values: 4:3 (1.3333334, Float:0x3FAAAAAB) when widescreen is turned off, 5:4 (1.2470589, Float:0x3F9F9FA0) when letterbox mode is turned on, and 16:9 (1.7764707, Float:0x3FE36364) when widescreen is turned on regardless of the letterbox mode.

```c
new szString[144];
format(szString, sizeof(szString), "Your aspect ratio: %f", GetPlayerCameraAspectRatio(playerid));
SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, szString);
```

:::tip

The return value of this function represents the value of the "widescreen" option in the game's display settings, not the actual aspect ratio of the player's display.
