        pVehicleHealthTD[playerid] = CreatePlayerTextDraw(playerid, x, y, " ");
        PlayerTextDrawShow(playerid, pVehicleHealthTD[playerid]);

        // Set a timer to update the textdraw every second
        pVehicleHealthTimer[playerid] = SetTimerEx("vhealth_td_update", 1000, true, "i", playerid);
    }
    if (oldstate == 2)
    {
        KillTimer(pVehicleHealthTD[playerid]);

    GetVehicleHealth(GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid), vHealth);

    format(tdstring, sizeof(tdstring), "Vehicle Health: %0f", vHealth);

    PlayerTextDrawSetString(playerid, pVehicleHealthTD[playerid], tdstring); // <<< Update the text to show the vehicle health
