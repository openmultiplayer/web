```c
public OnPlayerDeath(playerid, killerid, WEAPON:reason)
{
    // This example shows a large, white text saying "[playerName] has
    // passed away" on everyone's screen, after a player has died or
    // has been killed. It shows in text-type 3, for 5 seconds (5000 ms)
    new name[ 24 ], string[ 64 ];
    GetPlayerName( playerid, name, 24 );

    // Format the passed-away message properly, and show it to everyone:
    format( string, sizeof(string), "~w~%s has passed away", name );
    GameTextForAll( string, 5000, 3 );

    return 1;
