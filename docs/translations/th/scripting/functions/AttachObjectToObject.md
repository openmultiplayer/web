## ส่งคืน

1: The function executed successfully.

0: The function failed to execute. This means the first object (objectid) does not exist. There are no internal checks to verify that the second object (attachtoid) exists.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
new objectid = CreateObject(...);
new attachtoid = CreateObject(...);

AttachObjectToObject(objectid, attachtoid, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1);
```

## บันทึก

:::tip

Both objects need to be created before attempting to attach them. There is no player-object version of this function (AttachPlayerObjectToObject), meaning it will not be supported by streamers.
