0: The function failed to execute. This means the player is not connected.

## ตัวอย่าง

```c
// Example - Players can only drive vehicles if they have 10 score.
public OnPlayerStateChange(playerid, newstate, oldstate)
{
    if (newstate == PLAYER_STATE_DRIVER && GetPlayerScore(playerid) < 10) // PlAYER_STATE_DRIVER = 2
    {
        RemovePlayerFromVehicle(playerid);
    }
    return 1;
}
```

## บันทึก

:::tip

The exiting animation is not synced for other players. This function will not work when used in OnPlayerEnterVehicle, because the player isn't in the vehicle when the callback is called. Use OnPlayerStateChange instead(see the example below). The player isn't removed if he is in a RC Vehicle.
