:::tip

A player's name can be up to 24 characters long (as of 0.3d R2) by using SetPlayerName. This is defined in a_samp.inc as MAX_PLAYER_NAME. However, the client can only join with a nickname between 3 and 20 characters, otherwise the connection will be rejected and the player has to quit to choose a valid name.
