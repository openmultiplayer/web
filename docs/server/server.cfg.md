## Description

- `server.cfg` is a server configuration file which allows you to change all kinds of settings of your sa-mp server.
- This file is necessary for every server and has to be located in the server directory next to the server application (samp-server.exe).

| Setting       | Type   | Default value              | Read-only | Rule | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| echo          | string | Executing Server Config... | Yes       | No   | What samp-server.exe prints in the server console when executing server.cfg. There is no need to change this at all as you'll be the only one who sees the console.                                                                                          |
| rcon_password | string | changeme                   | No        | No   | The password used to administrate the server and use the remote console (rcon). You must make sure to change this to something hard to crack so that others cannot take control of your server. Your server will NOT start if changeme is the RCON password! |
| rcon          | bool   | 1                          | No        | No   | Toggles if the [Remote Console](RemoteConsole) feature should be used. Set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable.                                                                                                                                                   |

| ------------------- | ------ | --------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| gamemode(n) (N) (t) | string | gamemode0 grandlarc 1 | No        | No   | The .amx file in the gamemodes folder, the server should use to run as a gamemode. (n) is the gamemode number, (N) is the gamemode name without the .amx extension, and (t) is the amount of times the gamemode should be played before switching to the next gamemode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| filterscripts (N)   | string |                       | Yes       | No   | The .amx file in the filterscripts folder, the server should use to run as a filterscript. (N) is the filterscript name without the .amx extension. Filterscripts are scripts that run in the background of your gamemode. They are there to add extras to the server without editing the gamemode. It is very useful if you want to carry a specific property to more than one gamemode. If you have multiple filterscripts you want to load, put them all in a row separated by "space", e.g. filterscripts script1 script2. |
| plugins (N)         | string |                       | Yes       | No   | The .dll or .so file in the plugins folder, the server should use to run as a plugin. On Windows (N) is the plugin name without the .dll extension. However, on Linux the .so extension is needed! Plugins are scripts which are designed to enhance gamemodes and filterscripts. If you have multiple plugins you want to load, put them all in a row separated by "space", e.g. plugins plugin1 plugin2.                                                                                                                     |

## Server browser

| Setting      | Type     | Default value | Read-only | Rule | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| announce     | bool     | 1             | No        | No   | Toggles if the server should be announced to SA-MP masterlist. Set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| query        | bool     | 1             | No        | No   | Toggles if the server information should be displayed in the server browser. Set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Players can still join a server that has disabled querying, but the server browser will not display any information.                                |
| hostname     | string   | SA-MP Server  | No        | No   | The name that will be shown in the server browser and when the player connects to the server.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| language     | string   |               | No        | No   | The language that appears in the server browser. Players can use this to filter servers by language in the server browser.<br /> <br />**NOTE:** This server var was added in 0.3.7 and will have no effect in previous versions.                                    |
| mapname      | string   | San Andreas   | No        | Yes  | The mapname that appears in the server browser. This can be anything, e.g. My Stunt Map.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| gamemodetext | string   | Unknown       | No        | No   | The mode that will be shown in the server browser. Using [SetGameModeText](../scripting/functions/SetGameModeText) has the same effect and overrides the value used in server.cfg. If you have multiple gamemodes that require different gamemode texts, use that function. |
| weather      | string\* | 10            | No        | Yes  | The global weather that the server uses and will be shown in the server browser. Using this setting in the server.cfg file will crash the server application on startup. Use [SetWeather](../scripting/functions/SetWeather) instead to change this setting.                |
| worldtime    | string\* | 12:00         | No        | Yes  | The global time that the server uses and will be shown in the server browser. Using this setting in the server.cfg file has no effect. Use [SetWorldTime](../scripting/functions/SetWorldTime) instead to change this setting.                                              |
| gravity      | string\* | 0.008         | No        | No   | The global gravity that the server uses. Using this setting in the server.cfg file will crash the server application on startup. Use [SetGravity](../scripting/functions/SetGravity) instead to change this setting.                                                        |
| weburl       | string   | www.open.mp   | No        | Yes  | The website people can visit to gain more information about the server.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| version      | string   |               | Yes       | Yes  | The SA-MP version that the server uses and will be shown in the server browser. Using this setting in the server.cfg file has no effect.                                                                                                                             |
| maxplayers   | int      | 50            | Yes       | No   | The maximum amount of players your server can hold. By changing this number you can alter how many players can enter the server. The maximum is 1000 and the minimum is 1.                                                                                           |
| password     | string   |               | No        | No   | The password used to lock the server. When using this, only players that know this password will be able to join the server.                                                                                                                                         |

The server will be forced to use this IP address instead of automatically choosing a free IP address. This IP address must match one assigned to a network card on the server. This is useful for running multiple servers on the same port on the same box.                                                                                |

The format is based on the [strftime](http://cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/ctime/strftime/) format from C/C++. Here are some examples:<br /><br />**[%H:%M:%S]** This displays only the time, and is the default format for all previous SA-MP server versions.<br /><br />**[%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S]** This would display the date in dd/mm/yyyy format followed by the time in hour:minute:second format. |
| logqueries     | bool   | 0             | No        | No   | Toggles if all queries sent to the server by players should be logged. Set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. It is considerably useful during a DDoS attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| chatlogging    | int\*  | 1             | No        | No   | Toggles if player chat should be shown in the server console. Useful to stop the log from becoming bloated, or if you have another scripted chat logging solution.

## Notes

- Values marked as "Read-only" (as shown by `/rcon varlist`) can not be changed during runtime. All other values can be (temporarily) changed by passing them to SendRconCommand.
- Values marked as "Rule" (as shown by `/rcon varlist`) are displayed in the server browser in the Rules section.
- Scripts do not have to be in the gamemodes or filterscripts folders. The information in server.cfg is a path, and can therefore use "..".
