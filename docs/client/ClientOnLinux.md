# How to run the open.mp client on Linux

> **Warning:** You DO NOT get a working GUI, this must be executed in a Wine prefix via command line arguments.
### Tested on:

 - Lutris: wine-ge 8-26 32-bit prefix
 - Bottles: soda-9.0-1

### How to:

 1. Ensure you have a Wine prefix created with GTA San Andreas installed.
 2. Download the [open.mp](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/launcher/releases/latest) launcher and install it inside the Wine prefix.
 3. Download the [SA-MP client](https://github.com/KrustyKoyle/files.sa-mp.com-Archive) and install it in the same Wine Prefix.
 4. Download the [omp-client.dll](https://assets.open.mp/omp-client.dll) and copy it to the `AppData\Local\mp.open.launcher\omp\` folder of the main user in your prefix.

Finally, you can execute the open.mp launcher through the Wine prefixes CLI or write it to a .bat script for easy launching. 

### Sample launch command
```
Z:\path\to\omp-launcher.exe -h server.ip -p port -n user.name -g Z:\home\yourname\path\to\gta-san-andreas\install\
```

> You can run omp-launcher.exe with the --help flag to get more info about the flags, in case the example above isn't enough.
