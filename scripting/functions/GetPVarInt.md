| Name     | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerid | The ID of the player whose player variable to get.                          |
| varname  | The name of the player variable (case-insensitive). Assigned in SetPVarInt. |

## Returns

The integer value of the specified player variable. It will still return 0 if the variable is not set, or the player does not exist.

## Examples

```c
public OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid,reason)
{
    printf("money: %d", GetPVarInt(playerid, "money")); // get the saved value ('money')
    // will print 'money: amount'
    return 1;
}
```

## Notes

::: tip

Variables aren't reset until after OnPlayerDisconnect is called, so the values are still accessible in OnPlayerDisconnect.
