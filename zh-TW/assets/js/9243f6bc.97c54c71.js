If you create an object you can't just check that it was instantly sent to a player, because they might not be anywhere near it and thus the in-built streamer hasn't sent them it yet. To solve this, we first need to go on a slight tangent to explain how basic sync works for things like ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"SetPlayerPos"}),". When you set a player's position with ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"SetPlayerPos"})," the server does NOT update their position internally and for all other players straight away. Instead a ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"SET POSITION"})," command is sent to that one player being moved, they are teleported to the new position, and then report the new position back to the server in their next sync packet. The reason why is basically lag - there may be one or more sync packets still in flight with the old position after setting the new position. So what does this mean for mock players? It means you can't actually set their position, at least not in the normal way. There's no real client, so there's nothing receiving packets (i.e. the set position command), and there's nothing syncing that data back to the server again."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["We can generate any mock sync data for the server from mock players, so that is one way to update their position, but it can be a little cumbersome for just one common operation, so there is ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Mock_SetPlayerPos"})," for exactly this one use-case. But this still isn't quite the whole story, because we need the streamer to run and update with their new position, which happens only periodically (every few milliseconds, depending on the server tick rate). For this we have another mock function - ",(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Mock_Tick"}),", which jumps the server time forward by a given number of microseconds (NOT milliseconds). This should absolutely not be used on live servers as it can create all sorts of weirdness with timers and other time sensitive code, but can be used to fake time passing in tests.
