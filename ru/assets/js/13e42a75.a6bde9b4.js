Almost all of the operations on rational\nnumbers is hidden in the arithmetic. The only direct references to\nrational numbers are the \u201C%r\u201D format code in the printf statement near the bottom\nof function rpncalc and the call to rationalstr halfway function gettoken.\n\nThe first remarkable element in the file rpnparse.inc is the enum\ndeclaration, where one element has a tag (t_field) and the other element has a size\n(t_word). Function rpncalc declares variable field as an array using\nthe enumeration symbol as its size. Behind the screens, this declaration does more\nthan just create an array with 22 cells:\n\n/*The index tag of the array is set to the tag name \u201Ctoken:\u201D. This means that you can index the array with any of the elements from the enumeration, but not with values that have a different tag. In other words, field[t_type] is okay, but field[1] gives a parser diagnostic.\n\n/*The tag name of the enumeration overrules the tag name of the array variable, if any. The field variable is untagged, but field[t_value] has the tag Rational:, because the enumeration element t_value is declared as such. This, hence, allows you to create an array whose elements have different tag names.\n\n/*When the enumeration element has a size, the array element indicated with that element is sometimes treated as a sub-array. In rpncalc, expression \u201Cfield[t_type]\u201D is a single cell, \u201Cfield[t_value]\u201D is a single cell, but \u201Cfield[t_word]\u201D is a one-dimensional array of 20 cells. We see that specifically in the line:\n\n    printf  "Unknown  operator  \u2019%s\u2019\\n",  field[t_word]\n\nwhere the format code %s expects a string \u2014a zero-terminated array.\n\n\n\n\n\n`Rational numbers, see also the \u201CCelsius to Fahrenheit\u201D example on page page 16`\n\n`\u201Cenum\u201D statement: 101`\n\n`Another example of an index tag: page 68`\n\n\n\n// came to here\n\n\n\n\n***\n\nIf you know C/C\u207A\u207A  or Java, you may want to look at the switch statement.\nThe switch statement differs in a number of ways from the other languages\nthat provide it. The cases are not fall-through, for example, which in\nturn means that the break statement for the case EndOfExpr breaks out of the\nenclosing loop, instead of out of the switch.\n\nOn the top of the for loop in function rpncalc, you will find the\ninstruction \u201Cfield = gettoken(string, index)\u201D. As already exemplified in the\nwcount.p (\u201Cword count\u201D) program on page 19, functions may return arrays.\nIt gets more interesting for a similar line in function gettoken:\n\nfield[t_word] = word\n\nwhere word is an array of 20 cells and field is an array of 22 cells.\nHowever, as the t_word enumeration field is declared as having a size of 20 cells,\n\u201Cfield[t_word]\u201D is considered a sub-array of 20 cells, precisely matching the\narray size of word.\n\nListing: strtok.inc\n\n```c\n\n/* extract words from a string (words must be separated by white space) */\n#include <string>\n\nstrtok(const string[], &index)\n{\n    new length = strlen(string)\n\n    /* skip leading white space */\n    while (index < length && string[index] <= \u2019 \u2019)\n        index++\n\n    /* store the word letter for letter */\n    new offset = index     /* save start position of token */\n    new result[20]         /* string to store the word in */\n    while (index < length\n        && string[index] > \u2019 \u2019\n        && index - offset < sizeof result - 1)\n        {\n            result[index - offset] = string[index]\n            index++\n        }\n    result[index - offset] = EOS /* zero-terminate the string */\n\n    return result\n}\n\n'})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(n.code,{children:"\u201Cswitch\u201D statement: page 115"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Function strtok is the same as the one used in the wcount.p example.
